We will use <a href="https://keyman.com">Keyman</a> as the input tool. Keyman input tool is an
opensource input mechanism developed by SIL.

## Installation

Download keyman for mac from <a href="https://keyman.com/mac/download.php">here</a> and

    documentation</a> from their website.

Double click the DMG file and drag and drop the Keyman app into the ‘Input Methods’ folder.

Go to "System Preferences", then "Keyboard" and select the "Input Sources" tab. Or, click
on the input menu (usually a country flag or language icon) that appears on the right hand
side of the menu bar, then select "Open Keyboard Preferences". (This step may differ
slightly depending on the OS version.)
Click on "+", then find Keyman under Multi-Language and double click that entry to add as
